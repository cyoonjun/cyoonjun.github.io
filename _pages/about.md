# 👋 Hello! I'm **Yoonjun Cho**

I am a PhD student at Yonsei University, advised by Prof. Albert No. My research focuses on efficient large language models, with particular interest in quantization and low-rank adaptation. I am broadly interested in model compression, and my work seeks to revisit and rethink assumptions that have long been treated as standard practice. Moving forward, I plan to explore the quantization of discrete diffusion models, and investigate the role and construction of calibration datasets in compressed models.
