# 👋 Hello! I'm **Yoonjun Cho**

I am a PhD student at Yonsei University, advised by Prof. Albert No. My research focuses on efficient large language models, particularly on quantization and low-rank adaptation. I am broadly interested in model compression and plan to extend my work toward quantization for discrete diffusion models and large-scale reasoning models.
